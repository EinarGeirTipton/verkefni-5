		<h2>Brido</h2>
		<p>Birdo, known in Japan as Catherine (キャサリン Kyasarin), is a pink, anthropomorphic creature who wears a red bow on her head, and has a round mouth that can fire eggs as projectiles.[1] Her first appearance was as an enemy to Mario in Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic, which was localized for English audiences as Super Mario Bros. 2. Since then, Birdo has been a recurring character in various franchise spin-offs. Initially, she was depicted as an antagonist, but has since been depicted as an ally. Birdo has also made several cameos, particularly in the Mario Kart series and the Japan-only Wii video game Captain Rainbow.</p>
		<p>Birdo first appeared in the Family Computer Disk System video game Yume Kōjō: Doki Doki Panic and its Western Nintendo Entertainment System conversion Super Mario Bros. 2 as a boss. The Super Mario Advance remake of Super Mario Bros. 2 features a large robotic version of Birdo called "Robirdo".[2] Birdo/Catherine was prominently featured in the cut-scenes for the Japan-only, Satellaview pseudo-sequel of Super Mario USA (the Japanese title for the western version of Super Mario Bros. 2), known as BS Super Mario USA. In this version, three "Super Catherines" were voice-acted by Jun Donna (Pink, described as "slightly mischievous"), Rika (Red, "whose finances are always in the red"), and Akemi (Green, described as "cultured and affluent"). The voices were that of gay men or transgender women.[3][not in citation given] A Japanese advertisement for Super Mario USA also showed a costumed actor as Catherine lounging on a be
		d, with a low male voice.</p>

		<h2>Princess Daisy</h2>
		<p>Princess Daisy (Japanese: デイジー姫 Hepburn: Deijī-hime, [deː.ʑiː çi.me]) is the princess of the region of Sarasaland. She first appeared in Super Mario Land as the game's damsel in distress, a role usually reserved for Princess Peach. Since her appearance in Mario Tennis, she has become a staple playable character in the Mario spin-off games, in which she is often paired up with Peach. It is often speculated that she is Luigi's love interest.[16][17] Her official description for Mario Party 4 states that she and Luigi have a rumored mutual attraction, more so from Luigi; but Waluigi likes her too, which may cause trouble.</p>

<p>As of 2016, Daisy has appeared in 56 games, in most of which she is a playable character. Her first appearance in a main game of the Mario series is in Super Mario Land, released in 1989 for the Game Boy. Daisy is the princess of Sarasaland, a world outside of the series' usual setting of the Mushroom Kingdom, who is kidnapped by the tyrannical alien, Tatanga,[19] who intends to marry her in order to gain control of her realm. Mario must traverse the four kingdoms of Sarasaland in order to track down Tatanga and rescue Daisy. She next made a small appearance in NES Open Tournament Golf in 1991 as Luigi's caddy. She did not appear in another game for nine years until 2000's Mario Tennis by Camelot Software Planning on the Nintendo 64, in order to introduce more human characters into the game.</p>

Since Mario Party 6, she has regularly appeared in the Mario Party series as a playable character, with the exceptions of the handheld games, where she acts as a non-player character, and in the rest of the series in which she does not appear at all, until 2015's Mario Party 10, as an unlockable character.</p>

She appeared in Dance Dance Revolution Mario Mix as the owner of a hotel Mario and Toad must rebuild. She has made a cameo appearance in the introduction of Super Mario Galaxy.

She also appears in Mario Party DS as a non-playable character who needs help to get rid of a Hammer Bro. that has been damaging her musical instruments with his hammer. In this game, Toadette has a number of collectible musical items, such as her trumpets (even sometimes she also played with it in the musical theater in Mario Party: Star Rush). She appeared as a playable character in Mario Golf: World Tour, available via downloadable content. Toadette also appeared in Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker as a playable character along with Captain Toad. She appears in Super Mario Maker as a Mystery Mushroom costume through an update, with her appearance based on Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker. In Super Mario Run, Toadette is a playable character and the referee of Toad Rally. In Super Mario Odyssey, she gives Power Moons for completing achievements throughout the game.</p>

<p>Toadette is a mushroom like girl. She has the regular mushroom cap, except hers is pink with white spots, contrary to the usual white with colored spots.
